This project was completed for ECON422: Econometric Methods for Causal Analysis, an econometrics course taught at the University of Delaware Lerner College of Business and Economics. The professor for this course during the Fall 2025 semester was Dr. Emily Battaglia, an economist and Assistant Professor of Economics within the Lerner College of Business and Economics.

This project used the difference-in-differences method to evaluate the effectiveness of a poverty intervention program that was implemented in India. This program targeted many countries across the globe, but this project focused just on India. More information about this assignment, including the intervention program's research article and a description of the assignment, can be found within the 'overview' folder of this repository.

This was a group project that I completed with two of my classmates: Joshua Koppel and Jackson Bay. My major tasks for this project involved using STATA to evaluate both the random assignment of the study and the effectiveness of the poverty intervention program. Two data sets, both provided by Dr. Battaglia, can be found within the 'data' folder of this repository. One data set relates to household outcomes, and the other relates to health and politics. My corresponding STATA DoFiles and log files can be found within the 'STATA-files' folder of this repository.

The deliverable of interest is the report that the three of us worked on together. I focused primarily on discussing the random assignment results and the effects of the treatment program. I also constructed all tables and organized the report into different sections. For this project, we were required to make a report that resembled a published economics paper. Therefore, this report is written in first-person language and the tables are saved until the very end.
